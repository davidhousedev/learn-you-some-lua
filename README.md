# Learn you some Lua

We're gonna build a WoW addon! But first, you need to learn Lua.

## Complete each unit

Start with `01-Basics` in the `units` folder. Complete all readings and exercises in any order you like. Proceed through the units in numeric order.

### Exercises

Each unit will have some practical exercises to help you learn the concepts from your readings. Complete each of these exercises before moving on to the next unit.

### Lua Missions

Some units will ask you to make progress through [Lua Missions](https://github.com/kikito/lua_missions). These are small coding challenges that are completed in-order.

## Projects

Every few units you will have two projects: a `Programming Project` and a `WoW Addon Project`.

### Programming Project

These projects help you learn more about programming in-general. They teach you new concepts and make you a better coder.

### WoW Addon Project

These projects help you make progress towards building your first WoW Addon. Try to apply some of the lessons you learned in recent units in this project as well!
